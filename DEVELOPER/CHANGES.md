-Increased the base urine production rate from 1% to 1.2% per cycle, making the system slightly faster.

-Added Traits: (Most are not yet fully implemented but will be worked on in future updates.)
	Bladder Traits:

	Small Bladder: "Bladder fills quicker and more urgently." (+1 points)
	Bedwetter: "Involuntary urination while asleep." (+3 points)
	Urinary Incontinence: "Poor bladder control in general." (+5 points)
	Paruresis: "Urination is difficult when near zombies or players." (+4 points)
	Shy Bladder: "Urination is difficult without using the toilet." (+6 points)
	Large Bladder: "Bladder takes longer to fill." (-1 point)
	Bladder Control: "75% chance to stop urination 5% of the way through peeing self." (-3 points)

	Bowel Traits:

	Small Bowels: "Bowels fill quicker and more urgently. (+1 points)
	Bedsoiler: "Involuntary defecation while asleep." (+3 points)
	Fecal Incontinence: "Poor bowel control in general." (+6 points)
	Parcopresis: "Defecation is difficult when near zombies or players." (+4 points)

-Implemented Traits:
	Bedwetter: You will pee the bed if your bladder reaches near max value.
	Bedsoiler: You will poop the bed if your bowels reach near max value.

-Urgency Hiccup System:
	-Depending on your character's current mood and how full your bladder or bowels are, you might experience a "hiccup" of urgency. This could be a small reminder to go, or an unexpected accident.
	-Currently the only modifiers are "Panic" (increases chance of hiccup, doesn't impact accident chance yet), and "Drunkenness" (increases accident chance)
	-When you feel a sudden urgency, game speed slows down for a better reaction time.
	-The function that manages sudden accidents (formerly "CheckForAccident") is now renamed to HandleInstantAccidents. It triggers accidents in very sudden situations like being injured or overflowing bladder or bowels.
	-Hiccup chance is always 0 when sleeping, but as listed above, bedwetters and bedsoilers are still not safe.

-Cleaning Urine Puddles
	-Removed from inventory (as in not visible)
	-They cannot be picked up with the Grab function
	-They can be cleaned with either a Mop, Dish Towel, Bath Towel, or Toilet Brush
