Most of the sounds are loops.

Have:
- Medium pee ground sound when peeing on ground.
- Light pee ground sound when peeing self.
- Single fart sound when pooping, either self, toilet, or on ground.

Want:
- Light pee ground sound when peeing with clothes on.
- Medium pee ground sound when peeing without clothes on (using ground or peeing self without clothes).
- Light, Medium, Hard based on bladder fullness when using toilet.

- Might be impossible, but dynamically changing from hard, medium, to light when using the bathroom would be good.

- Pooping loops for ground, toilet, and possibly self.
